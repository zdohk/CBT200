//***FILE 200 is from TWA and contains the following programs:      *   FILE 200
//*                                                                 *   FILE 200
//*    Most of these programs were written by Rex Widmer and/or     *   FILE 200
//*    Peter Farrell.                                               *   FILE 200

//*    Some fixes were made by Roland Schiradin and Sam Golob.      *   FILE 200
//*    These were just so the programs would work.  The COBOL       *   FILE 200
//*    load module programs still need modernization.               *   FILE 200
//*                                                                 *   FILE 200

//*              A CHANGE IS CONSTITUTED TO MEAN A RE-LINKEDIT,     *   FILE 200
//*              OR A CHANGE BY SUPERZAP.  IT IS DRIVEN BY THE      *   FILE 200
